# Tic Tac Toe kata

**First iteration**

Try to implement the game of Tic Tac Toe as best as you can by following TDD practices.

**Second iteration**

Refactor you code to accomplish the Object Calisthenics rules.

## Rules
* A game has nine positions in a 3x3 grid
* X always goes first.
* Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board.
* Players cannot play on a played position.
* A player with three X’s or O’s in a row (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) wins.
* If all nine squares are filled and neither player achieves three in a row, the game is a draw.
