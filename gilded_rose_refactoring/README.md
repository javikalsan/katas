## Business Rules
  • At the end of each day items lowers quality and sellIn by one

  • Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast

  • The Quality of an item is never negative

  • "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets instead of decreasing

  • The Quality of an item is never more than 50

  • "Sulfuras" never has to be sold nor decreases in Quality (quality and sellIn does not change)

  • "Backstage passes": We don’t know the requirements

## First Iteration
Write unit tests test that validates the business rules.

## Second Iteration
Refactor the code. Use the automated IDE refactoring features through shortcuts instead of manual changes whenever possible to improve your refactoring velocity.
