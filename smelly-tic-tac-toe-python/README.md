# Smelly tic tac toe

Original source: [https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/CodeSmells](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/CodeSmells)

There are quite a few code smells in the implementation:

- Comments
- Data Class
- Data Clumps
- Divergent Change
- Duplicated Code
- Feature Envy
- Large Class
- Lazy Class
- Long Method
- Long Parameter List
- Message Chain
- Primitive Obsession
- Shotgun Surgery

Identify and refactor the code keeping the tests green.
